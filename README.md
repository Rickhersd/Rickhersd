My name is Ricardo Sánchez, and I am a Fullstack Developer.

From a young age, I had a strong interest in the world of programming and software development. At the age of fifteen, I decided to teach myself C# to create my own video games using Unity. During that time, I didn’t manage to create a game due to having overly ambitious ideas, but I learned a lot about programming. Over time, I decided to study web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, MySQL, JavaScript, and PHP. Years later, I started university, pursuing a degree in computer engineering, and decided to make my way into the professional world.

I currently work at a lottery bank as the head of development, leading multiple backend and frontend applications. I use Python for backend development and React and Next.js for the frontend. I work with technologies such as FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL, React, Next.js, Docker, and React Native, among others. I have worked with multiple libraries in the React and Vue ecosystems, developed Android applications with React Native, and built backend services using protocols like HTTPS, gRPC, and WebSockets.

In my free time, I study Rust and am focused on developing compilers and high-performance servers.
